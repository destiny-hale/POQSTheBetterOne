# POQS: The Better One
A game based off the original P.O.Q.S I made using Kaboom. This entire game was made using GDevelop.

In Practical Opulent Queryplan Shooter, you start out as a little smile character with the ability to heal yourself and shoot bullets toward the evilface enemies. 
Why? Because they're labeled as evil. And they hurt you on touch.

As you progress, you obtain more cash as you kill more enemies. More cash means more things you can buy in the Shop.

The shop allows you to upgrade how much damage you do, your total health, activate a double cash round, and buy new characters.

New characters come with new bullets and new abilities. Each bullet is tied to a character, but abilities can be used by any character.

Keep playing to learn the strategy and abilties of each character!

Maybe even find the source of the evilfaces?

To play, either download these files and open them with a GDevelop interface, download this zip file and run the .exe, or play it through liluo.io.
